Genet’s final opus is a lyrical and philosophical voyage to the bloody intersection of oppression, terror, and desire at the heart of the contemporary world. The play, then, seeks to understand and portray Genet’s imagination as well as his controversial insights on revolution, betrayal and deceit, homosexuality, violence, and love. Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig, therefore, is a response to Genet's daring claim and provocation: ""The end pursued by revolution is the discovery of beauty."" ","Rody Vera, Jose Estrella","Wilfrido Ma.
